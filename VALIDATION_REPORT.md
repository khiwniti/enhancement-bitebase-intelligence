## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics/AnalyticsWorkbench.tsx     # Consolidated analytics platform
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ growth/GrowthIntelligenceStudio.tsx  # Location intelligence studio  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ onboarding/RoleBasedOnboarding.tsx   # Role-based setup wizard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/RoleBasedDashboard.tsx     # Dynamic role-based dashboards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/AIResearchAgentMVP.tsx           # AI research agent MVP
```

### Role-Based Configuration System
- **Restaurant Owner**: Operational focus, simplified interface, revenue metrics
- **Marketing Manager**: Campaign-focused, medium complexity, engagement analytics
- **Data Analyst**: Advanced analytics, complex interface, comprehensive data tools

### Consolidated Navigation Patterns
1. **Single Entry Points**: Eliminated duplicate paths to same functionality
2. **Contextual Tools**: Tools appear based on user role and current workflow
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features hidden until user selects appropriate role
4. **Unified Branding**: Consistent [#74C365] brand color throughout interfaces

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### TypeScript Compilation Issues
- **Issue**: React 19 compatibility warnings for JSX type definitions
- **Impact**: Development warnings but no runtime issues
- **Status**: Non-blocking for functionality testing
- **Next Steps**: Consider React version alignment for production

### Badge Component Props
- **Issue**: Badge variant property not recognized in current UI library
- **Impact**: Styling warnings but components render correctly
- **Workaround**: Components fallback to default styling

### Module Resolution
- **Issue**: Some module import warnings for framer-motion, lucide-react
- **Impact**: Development time warnings
- **Status**: Components function correctly despite warnings

## üß™ Manual Testing Results
