# BiteBase Operational Hub - Restaurant Management Platform Design

## üéØ Vision Statement
Transform BiteBase from a passive intelligence dashboard into an active operational hub that serves as the central nervous system for daily restaurant operations, increasing daily active users from <10% to >70% of restaurant staff.

## üîÑ Current State vs. Future State

### Current State (Passive Dashboard)
- **Usage Pattern**: Occasional check-ins for market research
- **Users**: Mostly managers/owners doing strategic planning
- **Engagement**: Low frequency, high abandonment
- **Features**: Location intelligence, competitor analysis, historical reports

### Future State (Operational Hub)
- **Usage Pattern**: Multiple daily interactions during service
- **Users**: All restaurant staff (managers, servers, cooks, hosts)
- **Engagement**: High frequency, mission-critical dependency  
- **Features**: Real-time operations, task management, staff coordination

## üèóÔ∏è New Architecture: Three-Pillar Operational Framework

### Pillar 1: Live Operations Dashboard
**Real-time KPIs that matter during service:**
- Labor Cost % (live calculation based on clocked-in staff)
- Sales Pacing vs. Forecast (today's sales vs. expected)
- Average Table Turn Time (from seating to payment)
- Kitchen Ticket Times (order to ready)
- Staff Utilization Rates
- Inventory Alerts (low stock warnings)

### Pillar 2: Digital Task Management
**Replace paper checklists with smart, accountable systems:**
- **Opening Procedures**: Kitchen prep, FOH setup, equipment checks
- **Service Tasks**: Hourly cleaning, inventory checks, temperature logs
- **Closing Procedures**: Cash reconciliation, deep cleaning, prep for tomorrow
- **Photo Verification**: Critical tasks require photographic proof
- **Dependency Management**: Tasks that must be completed in order

### Pillar 3: Team Communication Hub
**Bridge the FOH/BOH communication gap:**
- **Shift Notes**: Pass information between shifts
- **Issue Reporting**: Quick incident reporting with photos
- **Staff Messaging**: Real-time communication during service
- **Manager Alerts**: Critical issues escalated automatically
