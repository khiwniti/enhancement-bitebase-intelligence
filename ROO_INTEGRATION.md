# Roo Code Integration Guide for BiteBase Intelligence 2.0

## Overview
This guide explains how to use Roo Code with the BiteBase Intelligence project for enhanced AI-assisted development.

## Installation

1. **Install Roo Code Extension**
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Roo Code"
   - Install the extension

2. **Configure API Provider**
   - Click the gear icon next to Roo Code extension
   - Select "Providers" on the left
   - Choose your preferred provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Enter your API key

## Configuration Files

### Main Configuration (`roo.toml`)
Contains project-specific settings including:
- Project structure and frameworks
- Mode configurations for different tasks
- Context settings for better understanding
- Quality requirements and standards

### Mode-Specific Rules
- `.clinerules-architect`: High-level design and architecture
- `.clinerules-code`: Implementation and coding standards
- `.clinerules-debug`: Debugging methodology and troubleshooting
- `.roomodes`: Custom mode definitions

### Agent Rules (`AGENTS.md`)
Comprehensive project guidelines for AI assistants including:
- Technology stack details
- Code standards and conventions
- Project structure overview
- Development workflows

## Available Modes

### Default Modes
- **Architect**: System design and architecture planning
- **Code**: Implementation and code generation
- **Debug**: Troubleshooting and issue resolution
- **Ask**: General assistance and exploration

### Custom Modes (defined in `.roomodes`)
- **Analytics**: Business intelligence features
- **NLP**: Natural language processing
- **Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard development
- **Connector**: Data integration and connectors
- **Deployment**: DevOps and infrastructure
- **Security**: Security implementation and review
- **Performance**: Optimization and monitoring
- **Testing**: Test development and quality assurance

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Feature
1. Use **Architect** mode to plan the feature architecture
2. Switch to **Code** mode for implementation
3. Use **Testing** mode to write comprehensive tests
4. Use **Debug** mode if issues arise

### Working with Analytics
```
Mode: analytics
Task: "Implement a new KPI calculation for customer retention analysis"
```

### Natural Language Features
```
Mode: nlp
Task: "Add support for date range queries in natural language"
```

### Dashboard Development
```
Mode: dashboard
Task: "Create a real-time revenue tracking widget"
```

## Best Practices

### Context Management
- Keep relevant files open in VS Code
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference existing patterns when possible

### Mode Selection
- Choose the most specific mode for your task
- Switch modes as your task evolves
- Use **Ask** mode for exploration and planning

### Code Quality
- Always run tests after implementation
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Rate Limits**: Use smaller code chunks or switch to a different provider
2. **Context Too Large**: Focus on specific files or directories
3. **Inconsistent Responses**: Check mode configuration and rules

### Getting Help
- Use **Ask** mode for project-specific questions
- Reference the `AGENTS.md` file for detailed guidelines
- Check existing implementations for patterns

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. Start with **Ask** mode to understand requirements
2. Use **Architect** mode for planning
3. Implement with **Code** mode
4. Test with **Testing** mode
5. Debug with **Debug** mode as needed

### Code Reviews
- Use **Security** mode to review security implications
- Use **Performance** mode to identify optimization opportunities
- Use **Testing** mode to ensure adequate test coverage

### Deployment
- Use **Deployment** mode for infrastructure concerns
- Use **Performance** mode for production optimizations
- Use **Security** mode for security hardening

## Advanced Features

### Memory Bank Integration
The configuration includes memory bank setup for:
- Persistent context across sessions
- Project-specific knowledge retention
- Pattern recognition and suggestions

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
Different modes can work together:
- **Architect** → **Code** → **Testing** workflow
- **Debug** → **Performance** optimization cycles
- **Security** → **Code** hardening process

## Maintenance

### Updating Configuration
- Modify `roo.toml` for project-wide changes
- Update mode-specific rules as needed
- Keep `AGENTS.md` current with project evolution

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Adjust mode configurations based on effectiveness
- Optimize context settings for better performance

This integration provides a comprehensive AI-assisted development environment tailored specifically for the BiteBase Intelligence project.
